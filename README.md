# High School Grade and Attendance Dashboard
Author: Mikkel Bjornson

## Background
Teachers and school administrators are presented with large amounts of students data, often in tables thousands of rows long. In this format, producing insights is often difficult or impossible. Presenting decision makers with the tools to analyze the data would allow more efficient identification and remediation of problem areas. Thus improving student growth and attendance. 
## Goals
-	Clean and present raw data in a usable format.
-	Present data visualizations to summarise key performance indicators. 
## Results
Through presentation and feedback of results from decision makers, a data dashboard was constructed. The data visualizations are presented for whole school data, as well as subgroups (academies), allowing for decision makers at different levels to view the data most important to them. For whole school visualizations, analysis focused on grades and attendence. These presented at the whole school, per student, and split by demographics levels. Academy analysis focused on grades presenting similar visualizations. In addition to visualizations, tables of cleaned data are presented along with tools to easily sort and filter. This allowed the identification of individuals for remediation. 

As proof of concept, an example dashboard with fake data is hosted at the follow link: https://mikkelbjornson.shinyapps.io/HS_dashboard_v2/
## Recommendations 
Creation of customized dashboards for teachers and administrators could increase the efficiency of identifying areas of improvement within a school and give the decision makers the insights needed to make those changes. Implementation of this strategy would likely be more beneficial than the one size fits all data management systems currently in use. 
## Benefits
The dashboard was welcomed by both school administrators and teachers as a means to assess the status of the school. Administrators and Counselors commented on the easy of use and increased efficiency when trying to identify areas to improve. Teachers similarly commented on the ability to identify areas to improve, but also commented on the benefit of seeing the effects of their labor.
